+ **Continuous Integration** - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/hkhbrus/AST-Project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/hkhbrus/AST-Project) - "*build passing*" indicates that the project's **tests** all **pass** as expected.

+ **Test/Code Coverage** - [![codecov.io Code Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/1apple7seeds/AST-Project.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://codecov.io/github/1apple7seeds/AST-Project) - coverage is the measure of how much of the code in a project is tested. Anything ***below 100% coverage*** means the module/library has ***potential bugs*** which are unknown to the authors/users.
